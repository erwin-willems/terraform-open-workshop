== Terraform output

You can use every part of a resource as an output. This is useful to get the value of a resource and use it in another resource.

=== Task: Create an output
* Create a new file `outputs.tf` and add the following content:

```hcl
output "private_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.private_ip
}
```

* Run `terraform apply` and `terraform output` to see the value of the output

It is also possible to get only the value of the output by running `terraform output private_ip`
