== Destroy the environment

Everything that is created by terraform can be destroyed by running the following command: `terraform destroy`.

=== Task: Destroy the environment
* Run `terraform destroy` and confirm the destruction of the environment by typing `yes`.

```
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes
